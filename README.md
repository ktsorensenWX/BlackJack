# BlackJack
## Topic
Using modularization to showcase simple Python mechanics in making a blackjack game. The game also contains unit test scripts to test for cases that occur within the main game such as getting an ace with a hand of 20.

## Goals
To create a simple blackjack game that implementes sudo-random card pulling. The code accounts for all situations that occur within blackjack and has a testing script that goes through several scenarios. The actual game itself is ran directly through the CLI as well, using CLI inputs as events that are then passed into the script.

## Running the Tester
Using the CLI, we can navigate to the Python file and simply run the script by calling the python command. This will run through the scenarios. This can also be done directly within VS Code if that's the IDE of choice.

## Methods and Libraries
As mentioned previously, this is a simple piece of code, created as an example to showcase modularity. The packages are very simple and come installed in most versions of python.
